This website to showcase Glasgow consist of a home page, history page and visit page. I have a nav bar which is fixed to follow down the page as well as onhover effect.

The colour scheme is derived from the Glasgow city Logo which I used Microsoft PowerToys Colour picker to get the correct hex codes. I used a picture of Glasgow for the background cause the white was boring.

The homepage includes a static map from Open Street Map, pinpointing the town's location and encouraging visitors to explore further.

The 'visit.html' page is structured with a 7:5 column ratio, utilising Bootstrap widgets to display information in an organized and interactive manner.

The 'visit.html' utilised google map to show an interactive interface of the murial trail

Regular commits with descriptive messages were made throughout the development process to track progress and changes effectively.

I  had an issue with css for the images in the history page which was supposed to have the images in the containers be in alternating allignment.

For some reason map on home page when first opening will be zoomed out, will zoom into glasgow soon or if you click to another page then back.

Not fan of my image formating : (
