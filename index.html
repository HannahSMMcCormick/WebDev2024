        <h2>About Glasgow</h2>

        <p>Glasgow, situated along both banks of the River Clyde in west-central Scotland, lies approximately 20 miles
            (32 km) from the river’s mouth on the western coast. As Scotland’s largest city, it forms an independent
            council area entirely within the historic county of Lanarkshire. The city occupies much of the lower Clyde
            valley, with its suburbs extending into surrounding districts. Glasgow’s Gaelic name, “Glaschu”, translates
            to “Green Glen.” Although evidence of a fortified prehistoric village exists on the site, Glasgow truly
            began to develop around 550 CE with the arrival of St. Kentigern (Mungo), who established a religious
            community there. The present Glasgow Cathedral, dedicated to St. Mungo and begun in the 12th century, stands
            on the site of the original chapel. Over time, Glasgow thrived as a market center due to its strategic
            location between Highland and Lowland Scotland, as well as its proximity to Edinburgh and the west. The
            city’s fortunes grew significantly after the union of the Scottish and English crowns in 1603. By the 18th
            century, trade with the Americas—exporting coal, plaid (wool cloth), herring, and later tropical produce
            like tobacco, sugar, and rum—brought prosperity to Glasgow’s merchants. Today, Glasgow continues to surprise
            and delight visitors with its colorful character, industrial history, incredible art, and vibrant music
            scene.</p>
